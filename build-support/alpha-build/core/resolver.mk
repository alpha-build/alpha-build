# Please submit an issue/pull request to the main repo if you need any changes in the core infrastructure.
# Before doing that, you may wish to consider:
# - updating the config files in build-support/alpha-build/config/ to configure tools for your own use case
# - writing a new custom rule, in build-support/alpha-build/extensions/<lang>/ and import it in the main Makefile

# Function:
# 	- resolve_since (only defined if since=<git-revision> is provided from the console)
# Description:

# Function:

# Description:
#	- Resolve on=... since=... to a list of target files/directories per language
# Args:
# 	- $1: language regex
# 	- $2: default targets e.g. $(ONPY)
# 	- $3: function that filters out targets (files or dirs), by default nothing is filtered out
# NOTE 1: Does not work if the command built is longer than `getconf ARG_MAX` characters
#         Especially relevant when running with since=... (e.g. since=HEAD~10000) over all the files (no on=...)
# NOTE 2: intersect_files would:
#         - ensure the target files exist (git diff --name-only also reports files that were deleted)
#         - ensure we only run the checks over the targets listed in the global $(ON<lang>) not across any changed <lang> file
